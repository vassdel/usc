The optional-silence phone sil occupies 17.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 65.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 10.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.7 hours of data, or 1.4 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 4.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (15,22.4,63)
